            Our club focuses on being an inclusive place for programmers of all levels - as such, activities
            vary based on skill level and fit to the individual. The club hosts several teaching sessions
            throughout the year both in-school and out of school. Additionally, the club is a place where 
            programmers can come together to work on projects and create an end-product. Finally, the club
            coordinates with other clubs with programming elements such as the Game Dev Club.
